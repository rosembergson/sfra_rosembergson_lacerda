# SFRA Training Base Repo
=================


# Requirements
------------

1. NodeJS version 8.x.x (to install and manage NodeJS see https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows for Windows or https://github.com/creationix/nvm for MacOS/Linux)
2. Yarn (install it globally with `npm install --global yarn`)


# Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone this repository to your local machine and follow instructions here to configure it properly: https://learninghub.osf.digital/course/view.php?id=29
2. Run `yarn install` to install all of the local dependancies
2. Run `yarn run compile:fonts` to compile and move all fonts inside app_storefront_training static folder
3. Run `yarn run webpack:dev` to start watching for file changes and compile JS and SCSS files when that happens
4. Run `yarn run lint` to run all the code linters or run:
    * `yarn run lint:js-server` to run only the server side JS linter
    * `yarn run lint:js-client` to run only the client side JS linter
    * `yarn run lint:scss` to run only the SCSS linter

5. Create dw.json file in the root of the project:
{
    "hostname": "your-sandbox-hostname.demandware.net",
    "username": "yourlogin",
    "password": "yourpwd",
    "code-version": "version_to_upload_to"
}

# Uploading your code
Install the Prophet extension into Visual Studio Code. It requires a valid dw.json file at the root that is configured for the sandbox to upload.

# Debugging
Create a launch.json file inside of a hidden directory named .vscode:
```
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
          "type": "prophet",
          "request": "launch",
          "name": "SFRA Debugger"
      }
    ]
}
```
#Testing
## Running unit tests

You can run `yarn test` to execute all unit tests in the project. Run `yarn run cover test/unit/**/*.js` to get coverage information. Coverage will be available in `coverage` folder under root directory.

* UNIT test code coverage:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the mfsg repository.
2. Enter the command: `yarn run cover test/integration/**/*.js`.
3. Examine the report that is generated. For example: `Writing coverage reports at [/Users/yourusername/SCC/sfra/coverage]`
3. Navigate to this directory on your local machine, open up the index.html file. This file contains a detailed report.

## Running integration tests
Integration tests are located in the `storefront-reference-architecture/test/integration` directory.

To run integration tests you can use the following command:

```
yarn run test:integration
```

**Note:** Please note that short form of this command will try to locate URL of your sandbox by reading `dw.json` file in the root directory of your project. If you don't have `dw.json` file, integration tests will fail.
sample dw.json file (this file needs to be in the root of your project)

# Recommended tools
-----------------

Visual Studio Code is recommended to be used along with the following plugins:

1. [SonarLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode) - To help you detect and fix quality issues as you write code. Like a spell checker, SonarLint squiggles flaws so they can be fixed before committing code.
2. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - To help you easily format and prettify your code (make sure you set `"prettier.tabWidth": 4` before you start using it)
3. [Document This](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joelday.docthis) - To help you with writing JSDoc for your code
    * CMD + Shift + P -> Format Document
    * Select the text you want to Prettify and CMD + Shift + P -> Format Selection
4. [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) - To help you autocomplete paths and filenames
5. [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertohuertasm.vscode-icons) - To make your VSC explorer a bit nicer
6. Wilson - Plugin created by OSF developers which allows you to use COVEO inside VS Code. Check this post on Community to learn more about itâ†’ https://community.osf-global.com/topic/2447-visual-studio-code-plugin-for-sfcc-coveo-ai-search/
7. [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync&ssr=false#overview) - Synchronize Settings, Snippets, Themes, File Icons, Launch, Keybindings, Workspaces, and Extensions Across Multiple Machines Using GitHub Gist.

Submitting a pull request
-------------------------

1. Create a feature branch from the develop branch (`feature/TASK-NR`)
2. Make sure all your comits have proper commit message (`[TASK-NR] Commit description`)
2. When creating your pull request make sure it has:
    * A proper title (use the following naming convention `[TASK-NR] Pull request title`)
    * A brief description of what the pull request does
    * (optional) Screen shots
3. Your code should pass the automation process:
    * Lint your code: `yarn run lint` should run withouth errors
    * Build your code: `yarn run webpack:dev` should run withouth errors

# Why the code structure here is different from the official one at https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud
1. Our cartridges structure make it easier to work with webpack
2. Our cartridges structure is easier to organize and makes more sense for SG developers
3. Github structure forces that each dev clones code in exactly the same way, same structure, same folders or it might break webpack
4. Github structure is prone to dependency inconsistencies since each cartridge has its own repo and package.json
